# How to Create a Pull Request from a Fork on GitHub.com

Creating a pull request from a fork on GitHub.com allows you to contribute to an open source project without having to download and clone the project locally. Here's how to do it:

## 1. Fork the Repository

Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## 2. Make Changes in Your Fork

In your forked repository, make the changes you want to contribute. This could be fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or updating documentation.

## 3. Create a New Pull Request

Once you've made your changes, navigate back to the original repository and click the "New pull request" button in the "Pull requests" tab. This will take you to a new page where you can create your pull request.

## 4. Compare Changes

In the "Comparing changes" section, select the base repository and branch that you want to merge your changes into. This is typically the main branch of the original repository.

Next, select your fork and branch that contains your changes.

## 5. Review Changes

GitHub will now show you the changes that you've made compared to the original repository. Review your changes and make sure everything looks correct.

## 6. Create Pull Request

If everything looks good, click the "Create pull request" button. This will create a new pull request in the original repository that includes your changes.

## 7. Wait for Review

The maintainers of the original repository will now review your changes and decide whether to merge them into the main branch. They may ask for additional changes or information before merging your pull request.

That's it! You've successfully created a pull request from a fork on GitHub.com. Keep an eye on your pull request for any updates or feedback from the maintainers. Good luck with your contributions!
